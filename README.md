### sinfract

weierstrass is more or less the standard weierstrass function generator.
sinfract is an experimental work in progress which tries to use Bessel functions. 

n = depth of fractal
k = scaling factor
amp = amplitude

Right now the program also generates a sound file from the function.

usage:
```
python weierstrass.py frequency n k amp
```
